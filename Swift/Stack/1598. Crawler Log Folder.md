[1598. Crawler Log Folder](https://leetcode.com/problems/crawler-log-folder/)

The Leetcode file system keeps a log each time some user performs a *change folder* operation.

The operations are described below:

* `"../"` : Move to the parent folder of the current folder. (If you are already in the main folder, **remain in the same folder**).
* `"./"` : Remain in the same folder.
* `"x/"` : Move to the child folder named `x` (This folder is **guaranteed to always exist**).

You are given a list of strings `logs` where `logs[i]` is the operation performed by the user at the `i<sup>th</sup>` step.

The file system starts in the main folder, then the operations in `logs` are performed.

Return *the minimum number of operations needed to go back to the main folder after the change folder operations.*

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/09/sample_11_1957.png)

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> logs = ["d1/","d2/","../","d21/","./"]
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation: </strong>Use this change folder operation "../" 2 times and go back to the main folder.
</pre>

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/09/sample_22_1957.png)

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> logs = ["d1/","d2/","./","d3/","../","d31/"]
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
</pre>

**Example 3:**

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> logs = ["d1/","../","../","../"]
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
</pre>

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= logs.length <= 10<sup>3</sup>`
* `2 <= logs[i].length <= 10`
* `logs[i]` contains lowercase English letters, digits, `'.'`, and `'/'`.
* `logs[i]` follows the format described in the statement.
* Folder names consist of lowercase English letters and digits.

**Solution 1:**

```
class Solution {
    func minOperations(_ logs: [String]) -> Int {
        var stack = [String]()
        for log in logs {
            if log == "../" {
                stack.popLast()
            } else if log != "./" {
                stack.append(log)
            }
        }
        return stack.count
    }
}
```

**Solution 2:**

```
class Solution {
    func minOperations(_ logs: [String]) -> Int {
        var ans = 0
        for log in logs {
            if log == "../" {
                ans -= ans > 0 ? 1 : 0
            } else if log != "./" {
                ans += 1
            }
        }
        return ans
    }
}
```
