[1544. Make The String Great](https://leetcode.com/problems/make-the-string-great/)

Given a string `s` of lower and upper case English letters.

A good string is a string which doesn't have **two adjacent characters** `s[i]` and `s[i + 1]` where:

* `0 <= i <= s.length - 2`
* `s[i]` is a lower-case letter and `s[i + 1]` is the same letter but in upper-case or **vice-versa**.

To make the string good, you can choose **two adjacent** characters that make the string bad and remove them. You can keep doing this until the string becomes good.

Return *the string* after making it good. The answer is guaranteed to be unique under the given constraints.

**Notice** that an empty string is also good.

**Example 1:**

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> s = "leEeetcode"
<strong>Output:</strong> "leetcode"
<strong>Explanation:</strong> In the first step, either you choose i = 1 or i = 2, both will result "leEeetcode" to be reduced to "leetcode".
</pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> s = "abBAcC"
<strong>Output:</strong> ""
<strong>Explanation:</strong> We have many possible scenarios, and all lead to the same answer. For example:
"abBAcC" --> "aAcC" --> "cC" --> ""
"abBAcC" --> "abBA" --> "aA" --> ""
</pre>

**Example 3:**

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> s = "s"
<strong>Output:</strong> "s"
</pre>

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 100`
* `s` contains only lower and upper case English letters.

```
class Solution {
    func makeGood(_ s: String) -> String {
        var newStr = ""
        for char in s {
            if let l = char.asciiValue, let last = newStr.last, let r = last.asciiValue, abs(Int(l) - Int(r)) == 32 {
                newStr.removeLast()
            } else {
                newStr.append(char)
            }
        }
        return newStr
    }
}
```
