[682. Baseball Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/baseball-game/)

You are keeping the scores for a baseball game with strange rules. At the beginning of the game, you start with an empty record.

You are given a list of strings `operations`, where `operations[i]` is the `i<sup>th</sup>` operation you must apply to the record and is one of the following:

* An integer `x`.
  * Record a new score of `x`.
* `'+'`.
  * Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores.
* `'D'`.
  * Record a new score that is the double of the previous score.
* `'C'`.
  * Invalidate the previous score, removing it from the record.

Return *the sum of all the scores on the record after applying all the operations*.

The test cases are generated such that the answer and all intermediate calculations fit in a **32-bit** integer and that all operations are valid.

**Example 1:**

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> ops = ["5","2","C","D","+"]
<strong>Output:</strong> 30
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
"5" - Add 5 to the record, record is now [5].
"2" - Add 2 to the record, record is now [5, 2].
"C" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5].
"D" - Add 2 * 5 = 10 to the record, record is now [5, 10].
"+" - Add 5 + 10 = 15 to the record, record is now [5, 10, 15].
The total sum is 5 + 10 + 15 = 30.
</pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> ops = ["5","-2","4","C","D","9","+","+"]
<strong>Output:</strong> 27
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
"5" - Add 5 to the record, record is now [5].
"-2" - Add -2 to the record, record is now [5, -2].
"4" - Add 4 to the record, record is now [5, -2, 4].
"C" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5, -2].
"D" - Add 2 * -2 = -4 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4].
"9" - Add 9 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9].
"+" - Add -4 + 9 = 5 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9, 5].
"+" - Add 9 + 5 = 14 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9, 5, 14].
The total sum is 5 + -2 + -4 + 9 + 5 + 14 = 27.
</pre>

**Example 3:**

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> ops = ["1","C"]
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
"1" - Add 1 to the record, record is now [1].
"C" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [].
Since the record is empty, the total sum is 0.
</pre>

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= operations.length <= 1000`
* `operations[i]` is `"C"`, `"D"`, `"+"`, or a string representing an integer in the range `[-3 * 10<sup>4</sup> , 3 * 10<sup>4</sup>]`.
* For operation `"+"`, there will always be at least two previous scores on the record.
* For operations `"C"` and `"D"`, there will always be at least one previous score on the record.

**Solution:**

```
class Solution {
    func calPoints(_ operations: [String]) -> Int {
        var stack: [Int] = []
        var sum: Int = 0
        for operation in operations {
            switch operation {
            case "C":
                stack.removeLast()
                break
            case "D":
                stack.append(stack[stack.count - 1] * 2)
                break
            case "+":
                stack.append(stack[stack.count - 1] + stack[stack.count - 2])
                break
            default:
                stack.append(Int(operation)!)
            }
        }
        for el in stack {
            sum += el
        }
        return sum
    }
}
```
